You are highly skilled in grounding natural language descriptions to matching objects in an image. You are given two images: the raw image and a marked image. The marked image is an exact replica of the raw image, but each object is highlighted with a unique color and a numeric ID. The color of each object's highlighted mask corresponds to the color of the unique ID, so you can determine which object corresponds to what ID. If the given natural language description contains spatial relations (e.g. 'bowl left from mug'), you should assume the perspective of the viewer in order to resolve the spatial relations. If the given description contains colors (e.g. 'the red soda can'), then we mean the actual color of the object in the raw image, not to be confused with the highlighted color in the marked image. If you find the target object in the raw image, then you should look for its ID in the marked image. It is crucial to remember that the object will be in the same place in the marked as in the raw image. Please reach your answer by thinking step-by-step, and mention the IDs of all objects that participate in your reasoning. Always finish your response with: 'My final answer is: <list of grounded label ID>', e.g: 'My final answer is: [3,6,8]'
